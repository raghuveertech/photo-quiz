# Photo Quiz - Interactive Image Guessing Game

Welcome to Photo Quiz, an interactive image guessing game where users can upload multiple images, customize the game settings, and challenge their friends to guess what's in the images!

## How to Play

1. **Upload Images:** Users can upload as many images as they want, providing a variety of challenges for their friends.

2. **Crop Images:** To increase difficulty, users can directly crop images by clicking on them, making it more challenging for participants.

3. **Customize Settings:** In the settings option, users can:

   - Choose the number of chances per image.
   - Select the difficulty level, which increases the number of numbered blocks to make the game more challenging.

4. **Quiz Screen:** Once images are selected, each image will be covered with numbered blocks according to the chosen settings.

5. **Host the Game:** As the host, share your screen with the participants. Instruct them to choose a number on the covered image.

6. **Reveal the Image:** Click on the chosen number, and that portion of the image will be revealed. Participants can try to guess what's in the image or select another number.

7. **Chances:** The number of chances is determined by the settings. If the participant fails to guess what's in the image, their points will be reduced for each chance taken.

8. **Reveal Button:** If a participant is stuck, they can use the "Reveal" button to make all the numbers disappear, earning them 0 points for that round.

9. **Next Image:** When ready, click the "Next Image" button to proceed to the next challenge, allowing participants to continue the game at their own pace.
